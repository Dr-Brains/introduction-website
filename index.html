          <h3>woodworking</h3>
          <p>After working as a designer for about a year, he need to do something other with my hands than clicking and typing became overwhelming. That's when I joined a woodworking class. After 2.5 years the class is over, but my love for
            woodworking is as big as it has ever been.</p>
          <p>So when I was not allowed to take the class again, I invested in a 'combin√©', a multi-purpose woodworking machine (a 5 in 1 machine). After a few years I felt the need to upgrade that machine, which I did just a few months ago. You can
            see my old machine on the left, and my new one on the right (don't mind the messy workshop)... An amazing upgrade if you ask me!</p>

        <h3>keyboards</h3>
        <p>As a developer (or a designer), you spend your whole day behind a computer, giving commands to the machine via your mouse and keyboard. Your keyboard is an extension of yourself. So why not do something nice with your input device?</p>
        <p>This is where mechanical keyboards come in to play. There are literally endless possibilities when it comes to customising mechanical keyboards: form factor, case, layout, type of switches, keycaps, cable, ... Everything can be adjusted to
          suit your taste.</p>
        <p>My taste happens to be the 'Planck' keyboard. A tiny, ortholinear (that means the keys are in a grid, not staggered) keyboard with 100% customizability through the firmware.</p>
        <p>There is a lot more to say about keyboards, so if you're interested, ask about them in class ;)</p>
